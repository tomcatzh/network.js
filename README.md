# Network.js [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/nesk/network.js.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/nesk/network.js)

A __JavaScript__ library, entirely written in ES6, to measure various aspects of a connection. It can accurately estimate a bandwidth/latency between a client (using a web browser) and a server (running a specific script).

## 中文版的更改
我没有做大的改变，只是汉化了Example文件，同时增加了利用奇虎360的[奇云测](http://ce.cloud.360.cn/)进行中国各地区性能测试的链接。

我用这个版本，在[AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/)上建立并且共享了一个叫做ChinaSpeedTest的AMI，大家可以搜索直接启用。

## Installation

Use Bower or download an archive [from the releases page](https://github.com/nesk/network.js/releases):

```shell
bower install network-js
```

```html
<script src="bower_components/network-js/dist/network.min.js"></script>
```

Next, add the [server.php](server/server.php) on your web server.

## How to use

```js
var settings = {

    endpoint: 'path/to/the/server.php', // Where is located the PHP file.

    // The complete settings list is available below.

};

// Create a new Network instance by providing an optional object.
var net = new Network(settings);

// Listen for the "end" event which provides the calculated latencies.
net.latency.on('end', function(averageLatency, allLatencies) {
    // "allLatencies" is an array containing the five calculated latencies in
    // milliseconds. They're used to determine an average latency.
    console.log('end', averageLatency, allLatencies);
});

// Once all the configuration is done, start the requests for this module.
net.latency.start();

// It is possible to chain functions for all the modules, here's an example with the
// upload module.
net.upload
     .on('start', function(dataSize) {
         console.log('start', dataSize);
     })
     .on('progress', function(averageSpeed, instantSpeed) {
         // Every bandwidth measure are in Mega BYTES per second!
         console.log('progress', averageSpeed, instantSpeed);
     })
     .on('restart', function(dataSize) {
         // The restart event is triggered when the module didn't have time
         // (according to the `delay` option) to take all the measures. A new
         // request will start with data size increased by the multiplier value.
         console.log('restart', dataSize);
     })
     .on('end', function(averageSpeed, allInstantSpeeds) {
         console.log('end', averageSpeed, allInstantSpeeds);
     })
     .start();

// You can also cancel a request (except for the "latency" module).
net.upload.abort();

net.download
     .on('start', function(dataSize) {
         console.log('start', dataSize);
     })
     .on('progress', function(averageSpeed, instantSpeed) {
         console.log('progress', averageSpeed, instantSpeed);
     })
     .on('restart', function(dataSize) {
         console.log('restart', dataSize);
     })
     .on('end', function(averageSpeed, allInstantSpeeds) {
         console.log('end', averageSpeed, allInstantSpeeds);
     })
     .start();

net.download.abort();
```

### Settings

The available settings with their default values:

```js
{
    latency: {
        // Where is located your `network.php` file.
        endpoint: './network.php',
        // How many measures should be returned.
        measures: 5,
        // How much attempts to get a valid value should be done for each measure.
        attempts: 3
    },

    upload: {
        // Where is located your `network.php` file.
        endpoint: './network.php',
        // The delay while you want to take measures.
        delay: 8000,

        data: {
            // The amount of data to initially use.
            size: 2 * 1024 * 1024, // 2 MB

            // If the measure period can't reach the delay defined in the settings,
            // the data amount is multiplied by the following value.
            multiplier: 2
        }
    },

    download: {
        // Where is located your `network.php` file.
        endpoint: './network.php',
        // The delay while you want to take measures.
        delay: 8000,

        data: {
            // The amount of data to initially use.
            size: 10 * 1024 * 1024, // 10 MB

            // If the measure period can't reach the delay defined in the settings,
            // the data amount is multiplied by the following value.
            multiplier: 2
        }
    }
}
```

Here is an example usage:

```js
var net = new Network({
    // If you define a value at the top level of the object,
    // it will be applied to every module.
    endpoint: './my-new-endpoint/',

    download: {
        data: {
            multiplier: 2.5
        }
    }
});
```

You can also redefine settings whenever you want:

```js
// The `settings()` method takes an object in parameter.
net.settings({
    endpoint: './my-second-new-endpoint'
});

// Without any parameters, it will return the current settings.
console.log(net.settings()); // Prints the current settings in the console.

// Each module has a `settings()` method that works the same way.
net.latency.settings({
    measures: 10
});
console.log(net.latency.settings());
```

### Server configuration

If you use Apache with its default configuration, everything should work.

If you get any errors, check your server configuration, you must:

* Disable persistent HTTP connections and add a `Connection: close` header to responses.
* Disable any form of cache with `Cache-Control: no-cache, no-store, no-transform` and `Pragma: no-cache`.
* Disable GZIP compression.
* Disable the body size limit.

## Compatibility

Network.js is based on two browser features: [Resource Timing](http://caniuse.com/#feat=resource-timing) and [XMLHttpRequest (v2)](http://caniuse.com/#feat=xhr2). While the first one [can be polyfilled](client/timing.js), the second one is a requirement.

Thus, Network.js should be compatible with:

| Browser              | Partial support (polyfill) | Native support |
| -------------------- | :------------------------: | :------------: |
| IE 10+               |                            | ✔              |
| Firefox 35+          |                            | ✔              |
| [Chrome 29+][1]      |                            | ✔              |
| Opera 15+            |                            | ✔              |
| Android Browser 4.4+ |                            | ✔              |
|                      |                            |                |
| Safari 5+            | ✔                          |                |
| iOS Safari 5.1+      | ✔                          |                |
| [Firefox 12+][1]     | ✔                          |                |
| Opera 12.1+          | ✔                          |                |
| Android Browser 3+   | ✔                          |                |

Latency measures can be __very far__ from reality if the browser doesn't support Resource Timing and uses the provided polyfill. You can determine if the browser uses the latter:

```js
if (Network.supportsResourceTiming) {
    // Resource Timing is available.
} else {
    // The polyfill will be used, expect some weird latency measures.
}
```

## Caveats

* Chrome cannot upload a __~128 MB__ file, which will mainly affect fiber users.

## Compilation

To compile the project, install the latest version of [Node](http://nodejs.org/) and run these commands inside a terminal:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/nesk/network.js.git
cd network.js
npm install
npm run build
```

There's also a `watch` script which compiles the project whenever a file is changed:

```shell
npm run watch
```

To check if the project passes all the tests, run:

```shell
npm test
```
